## IoT Smart Home Automation System
The IoT Smart Home Automation System enables users to remotely control and monitor smart devices like lights, fans, and security systems using Blynk UI and Google Home. Powered by ESP32 microcontrollers and connected sensors, the system integrates various smart home technologies for enhanced convenience, security, and energy efficiency.

### Key Features:
- Remote Control: Control devices (e.g., lights, fans, alarms) from anywhere through mobile apps (Blynk) and voice commands via Google Assistant.
- Security Integration: Built-in sensors (motion, door) trigger alarms upon detecting unauthorized activity, enhancing home security.
- Energy Efficiency: Devices are controlled automatically based on conditions like temperature, helping conserve energy.
- Voice Commands: Integration with Google Home allows users to control devices with voice commands.
- Real-time Monitoring: Get instant updates and alerts on unusual activities via the Blynk.
- This project demonstrates the potential of IoT in creating smarter, safer, and more energy-efficient homes using automation and remote control.
